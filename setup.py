    # List run-time dependencies here.  These will be installed by pip when
    # your project is installed. For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's
    # requirements files see:
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html
    # install_requires=["tensorflow==1.11.0","tensorflow-gpu==1.11.0", "pillow==5.4.1", "numpy"],

    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). You can install these using the following syntax,
    # for example:

    # $ pip install -e .[dev,test]
    # extras_require={
    #    'dev': ['check-manifest'],
    #    'test': ['coverage'],
    # },

    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.  If using Python 2.6 or less, then these
    # have to be included in MANIFEST.in as well.
    # Attention: the root folder (used as keys) in package data must be dot separated if it goes deeper and not with /
    # example src.sng_parser instead of src/sng_parser

    # data_files=[('project/configuration', ['project/configuration/configuration.ini.template'])],

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files # noqa
    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'
    # data_files=[('my_data', ['data/data_file.txt'])],
